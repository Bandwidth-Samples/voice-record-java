# Description
A short description of your sample app and its capabilities. 

# Bandwidth

In order to use the Bandwidth API users need to set up the appropriate application at the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and create API tokens.

To create an application log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and navigate to the `Applications` tab.  Fill out the **New Application** form selecting the service (Messaging or Voice) that the application will be used for.  All Bandwidth services require publicly accessible Callback URLs, for more information on how to set one up see [Callback URLs](#callback-urls).

For more information about API credentials see [here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/guides/accountCredentials.html#top)

# Environmental Variables
The sample app uses the below environmental variables.
```sh
BW_ACCOUNT_ID                 # Your Bandwidth Account Id
BW_USERNAME                   # Your Bandwidth API Token
BW_PASSWORD                   # Your Bandwidth API Secret
BW_NUMBER                     # Your The Bandwidth Phone Number
BW_VOICE_APPLICATION_ID       # Your Voice Application Id created in the dashboard
BW_MESSAGING_APPLICATION_ID   # Your Messaging Application Id created in the dashboard
BASE_CALLBACK_URL             # Your public base url
LOCAL_PORT                    # The port number you wish to run the sample on
```

# Callback URLs

For a detailed introduction to Bandwidth Callbacks see https://dev.bandwidth.com/guides/callbacks/callbacks.html

Below are the callback paths:
* `/callbacks/voiceCallback`
* `<add other callbacks>`

## Ngrok

A simple way to set up a local callback URL for testing is to use the free tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  
After you have downloaded and installed `ngrok` run the following command to open a public tunnel to your port (`$LOCAL_PORT`)
```cmd
ngrok http $LOCAL_PORT
```
You can view your public URL at `http://127.0.0.1:{LOCAL_PORT}` after ngrok is running.  You can also view the status of the tunnel and requests/responses here.
